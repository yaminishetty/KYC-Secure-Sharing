install python 3.7.0 and i did all settings inside hello-eth ethereum tool


install node-v12.13.1-64.msi software 
then install packages from requirements.txt file

After contract deployment in etherum black window you will get contract address under KYCContract section and that contract
address you replace in SecureKYC/SecureApp/views.py python file

in SecureKYC/SecureApp/views.py file you can see contract address like '0xd374Cb05bd6187D6cF905D7bBD85f2b704fBDD29' 
this at line no 23, 43 and 64 and just replace this with new contract address
